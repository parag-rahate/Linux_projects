A Linux project to maintaining optimal system performance and proactively identifying potentials issues.<br>

### Importance of Monitoring <br>
* Monitoring is the proces of collecting an analyzing data about the health an performance of your system. It is essential for preventing problems, identifying bottlenecks and ensuring that your system is performing at its best.<br>
* Poor system performace can have a number of negative conequences, including decreased prouctivity, reduced relaibility and increased security risks. Proavtive monitoring can help to identify and resolve problems before they cause significant disruption.<br>

### Key metrics to monitor <br>
* **CPU Utilization:** This metric measure the percentage of time that the CPU is busy processing task. High CPU utilzation canindicate the bottleneck in the system. <br>
* **Disk I/O:** This metric measures the amount of data that is being read and written to the disk. High disk I/O can indicate a bottleneck or a disk failure. <br>
* **Network traffic:** This metric measures the amount of data that is being transmitted over the network.High network traffic can indicate a bottleneck or a network problem. <br>
* **Application performance metrics:** This includes metrics specific to the applications that are running on your system, such as response times and throughput. <br>

### Traditional Monitoring Tools

* **htop:** This tool provides a real-time overview of the system's resource usage.

* **vmstat:** This tool provides detailed statistics about the system's memory and CPU usage

* **fostat:** This tool provides statistics about the system's disk and network I/O

* **sar:** This fool collects historical data about the system's performance.

* **Other specialized monitoring tools:** There are a number of other specialized monitoring tools that can be used for specific purposes, such as database monitoring and network monitoring.

### Automated Monitoring with Cron Jobs <br>
* Automating your monitoring tasks can save you time and reduce the likelihood of errors. Cron jobs are a type of scheduling tool that can be used to run scripts at regular intervals. <br>
* By automating your monitoring tasks with cron jobs, you can ensure that your system is always being monitored, even when you are not available to manually check it. <br>

### Alerting For Critical Events

* Setting up alerts for critical events can help you to take corrective action quickly before problems escalate. You can set alerts for events such as high CPU utilization, low memory usage, and high disk I/O. <br>
* You can use a variety of alerting mechanisms, such as email, SMS, or push notifications, to notify the appropriate personnel of critical events. <br>
